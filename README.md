### Requirements

- Dropbox 33.4.xx
- Vagrant v1.9.xx
- VirtualBox v5.1.xx

### Notes
- $ git clone requires GIT CMD
- CMD needs to be run as administrator.
- After installing, update the BIOS setting to enable VT-x. On Windows 10, go to 
		``Settings -> Update & Security -> Recovery -> Advanced startup -> Restart Now -> Troubleshoot -> Advanced Options -> UEFI Firmware Settings`` and change ``Intel VT`` to ``enable``.

# Getting Started
- The first steps will be to establish a local development environment on your local machine.

### Steps

1. Install Software Requirements listed above on your local machine
2. Create ngm folder on your local machine in your development folder

		$ i.e. mkdir ~/Users/fitzpaddy/Sites/ngm

3. Clone ``ngm-reportShell`` repository in ``ngm`` folder

		$ cd ~/Users/fitzpaddy/Sites/ngm
		$ sudo git clone https://github.com/pfitzpaddy/ngm-reportShell.git

4. Copy contents of [ngm folder](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fg4nqibkiqbr80x/ngm.zip?dl=1) and place in ``ngm`` folder

### Result
- The ``ngm`` folder will now contain the following structure
|-- ngm
|---- csv
|---- data
|---- kobo
|---- ngm-reportShell
|---- mongo
|---- scripts
	

# Vagrant Local Server
- Run the following commands to setup the local development environment.

### Steps
  
1. on the cmd line, navigate to ``ngm/ngm-reportShell`` folder

		$ i.e. cd ~/Users/fitzpaddy/Sites/ngm/ngm-reportShell
		
3. Update the GitHub repository locations to your forked version of the code

		# UPDATE TO YOUR FORKED REPO! (lines 146 & 168)
		sudo git clone https://github.com/<your.fork>/ngm-reportHub.git

5. Run [Vagrant Up](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/cli/up.html) command

		$ vagrant up
		
	> NOTE: This will take some time to fetch the Ubuntu Lts 14.04 VirtualBox image as well as install server software to establish a replica local server environemnt

5. During install, review VirtualBox configurations in 
	- ``ngm-reportShell/Vagrantfile``
	- ``ngm-reportShell/ngm-reporthub.shell.build.sh``


# Running ReportHub
- Once the VirtualBox is completed installation, you can access the configured ReportHub Ubuntu LTS 14.0.4 Virtual Machine via the ``vagrant ssh`` command

### Steps

1. Within the ``ngm-reportShell`` folder, ssh into machine

		$ vagrant ssh
		
2. Within the server, navigate to the ``ngm-reportEngine`` repository

		$ cd /home/ubuntu/nginx/www/ngm-reportEngine
		
3. Start the Sails RestAPI application

		$ sudo sails lift

4. Navigate to [http://192.168.33.16](http://192.168.33.16) and ReportHub is running!
